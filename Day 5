Day 5 of #100daysofkubernetes
Building your image 

Yesterday we covered the Dockerfile - we've written our container blueprint, what next?
Enter stage left: the docker build command. 

In your terminal, enter: docker build [location of Dockerfile] 
Don't forget in linux you can use . to indicate the current working directory

It's at this time that we might also tag the image with the -t flag. Very useful for versioning

You are able to have multiple tags a la 
	docker build -t whenry/fedora-jboss:latest -t whenry/fedora-jboss:v2.1 .
  
Wait, after I build the image, where does it go?  Good question, Tim. If you 'docker inspect [imageID]' then we'll see a ton of cool info, but also where the layers of the image live; typically /var/lib/docker/ but the 'docker info' command will show explicitly where the Docker Root Dir is configured.

Once built, if you're feeling chummy, you might then docker push the image for others to enjoy the fruits of your labor 

Or just use it yourself via docker run [shiny-new-image-name]

Interesting factoid from the docs:
"Remember that the docker daemon could be running on a remote machine and that no parsing of the Dockerfile happens at the client side (where youâ€™re running docker build)."
