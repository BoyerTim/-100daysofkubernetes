Day 13 of #100daysofkubernetes

This post https://twitter.com/heyJTK/status/1481652902913458184 is pretty interesting for a few reasons.
Immediately we see that at least 2k people agree that Docker is "lowkey terrible" 
Further down the thread the co-creator of Docker chimes in, always interesting to see an inventor speak about his creation.

A lot of sentiment seems to be that docker is handy for dev environments, less so for prod
Funny enough, a lot of other people say it's great for prod but terrible for dev.

Some other critiques:

I agree that the dx is just not ideal:
 - combing through a JSON dump when want a container IP
 - running out of disk space because docker doesn't free up disk space
 - weird CLI behavior of docker-compose
 - docker run <something-with-typo> and you have malware
 
 
On the other hand,

 Most complaints on Docker DX are due to badly written ‚Äúdocker-compose‚Äù files and/or inefficient workflows that run a build on every single interaction.

It is not the hammer‚Äôs fault if you need a screwdriver.

Besides the Docker back and forth I also learned about WebAssembly and NixOS, two things I hadn't heard of before.
