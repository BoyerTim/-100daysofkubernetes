Day 12 of #100daysofkubernetes

Wild Friday night spent going through the official Docker tutorial.  Feel like I've been bouncing around with my studies and have been meaning to just go through it.

Some tricks I learned along the way

docker rm -f [containerID] can be used to kill a container without having to stop it THEN remove it. #lazy

Speaking of lazy, you don't need to type out the whole container id when referencing one. The first few characters should suffice.

Since a docker container exits when it's main process ends, we can add && tail -f /dev/null to the docker run to keep the container running indefinitely (useful for debugging, I imagine). 
Ex:  docker run -d ubuntu bash -c "shuf -i 1-10000 -n 1 -o /data.txt && tail -f /dev/null"

learned about the docker exec command which lets you interact with a (detached) container without having to foreground it, er, re-attach it.  

Containers are ephemeral but my data demands permanence, damnit! Volumes solve this problem. The tutorial does a good job demonstrating this by creating a volume, deploying a container that recognizes the volume, writing to a sqlite db, killing the container, spinning up a NEW container and seeing our data inputted from the initial container. Neat.
