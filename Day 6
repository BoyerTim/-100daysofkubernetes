Day 6 of #100daysofkubernetes

Now that we've built our image, we need to initialize it and deploy our container.  

At the bare minimum we must say 'docker run [imageID]'

However there are many, many options to be used with docker run
Syntax: docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]


Common options include:
running the container detached (in the background) via the -d switch 

"By design, containers started in detached mode exit when the root process used to run the container exits, unless you also specify the --rm option. If you use -d with --rm, the container is removed when it exits or when the daemon exits, whichever happens first."
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d
Giving the container a name via --name [desired_container_name]

If necessary you might want a direct shell into your container
docker run -it image /bin/bash

Other run options might include port mapping, volume mounting, clean up, or runtime constraints.
