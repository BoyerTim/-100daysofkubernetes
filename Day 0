*Looking forward to pushing myself to get more comfortable with #Kubernetes this year - join me on my #100daysofkubernetes challenge!
*Day 0 of #100daysofkubernetes: I know that k8s handles container orchestration, but honestly even my basic container knowledge isn't that great. I'll likely spend a week or two getting more comfortable with Docker https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

I did watch this video https://youtu.be/iqqDU2crIEQ "How to Get Started with Docker" from @pmckee. He goes a bit fast but it's a good initial glance at what Docker/containers provide: lightweight, immutable instances that can be easily shared and executed.

One of the key things he addresses in the video is that there's essentially three phases for a docker image:
Build. Ship. and Run.  

Outstanding questions:
Question: What's the difference in building a custom docker image (using the build command) versus using an image via the FROM command in the docker file?
    I'm pretty sure the FROM command in the dockerfile is essentially a "base" image but I'm not certain
  
What's the difference between docker run vs docker start commands

When might you use docker compose vs just a regular docker instance?


Bonus Points:
Tangential but somewhat relating to Docker - in order to import a "custom" linux distro for WSL2, Docker is used to download the relevant tar file.
