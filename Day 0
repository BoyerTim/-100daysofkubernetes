Looking forward to pushing myself to get more comfortable with #Kubernetes this year - join me on my #100daysofkubernetes challenge!

Day 0 of #100daysofkubernetes: I know that k8s handles container orchestration, but honestly even my basic container knowledge isn't that great. I'll likely spend a week or two getting more comfortable with Docker https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
